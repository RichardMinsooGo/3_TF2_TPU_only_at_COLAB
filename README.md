This session target is to complete the DQN, Double DQN, Dueling DQN from deep sarsa model.
We will use cartpole, mountaincar, grid world model.
If possible pendulum model will be used.
Cartpole, mountaincar, grid world are discrete models, but pendulum model is continuous model.
Still we cannot confirm that pendulum will converge or not with DQN models.

Let's discover the differences.
